LHAPDF v6 CONFIGURATION FLAGS
=============================

Documentation of the configuration flags for use in LHAPDF at the global
settings, PDF set info, and PDF member info levels. If a configuration key
is requested from a PDF member info and is not found, the search will fall
back to first the PDF set and then to the global config.


Note that there is no such thing as a uniquely config-level or set-level
quantity: all flags may be set at config, set, or member level -- what
determines the functionality is the value as evaluated on a PDF member
regardless of whether it is set directly on that member or if it has cascaded
down from a higher grouping level.


CONFIG LEVEL
============

@note The flags listed here are simply most *likely* to be used at config-level,
but they can be set differently for each set or for each member in a set if so
desired. Flags set at a more specific level always take precedence.


Verbosity
---------
(uint)

Level of verbosity of the LHAPDF system. 0 is silent, 1 is the default and will
print out minimal information about a PDF set or member when first initialized,
2 will print out more verbose information, and higher values are reserved for
future use to print out extremely verbose information during PDF use -- this
will be for debugging only, since printouts during PDF evaluation will slow down
the operation of LHAPDF by potentially large factors.


ShowBanner
----------
(bool)

Whether or not to print out an LHAPDF5-style banner to stdout. (Triggered in Config destructor)

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED! Will be once an LHAPDF6 paper is available to cite...


Pythia6LambdaV5Compat
---------------------
(bool)

An LHAPDF5 compatibility mode flag which sets all LambdaQCD common block values
to 0.192 as was historically the case for PYTHIA6's use of LHAPDF. This
behaviour is physically incorrect, as well as against the spirit of the PYTHIA6
steering flags, but it is the long-term behaviour of PYTHIA6+LHAPDF and many
PYTHIA6 MC tunes have been built around this behaviour. This flag is set 'true'
by default to minimise user surprise -- most users will expect PYTHIA6 to behave
the same with both LHAPDF5 and 6. If you want LHAPDF6 to report correct,
i.e. PDF specific, values to PYTHIA6, then explicitly set this flag to be false.


SET LEVEL
=========

@note The flags listed here are simply most *likely* to be used at set-level,
but they can be set differently for each member in a set (or at the global
config level) if so desired. Flags set at a more specific level always take
precedence.


SetDesc
-------
MANDATORY
(string)

A human-readable description of this PDF set.


SetIndex
--------
OPTIONAL, but should be set for sets with assigned LHAPDF IDs
(int)

The LHAPDF global ID code for the first member in this PDF set.


Authors
-------
MANDATORY
(free string)

Authors of this PDF set.


Year
----
OPTIONAL
(uint)

Year in which this PDF fit was made.


Reference
---------
OPTIONAL
(free string)

A reference to the paper that describes this PDF set. Use semicolons
to separate a standard journal string, arXiv ID, DOI code, etc.


Particle
--------
OPTIONAL
(int): e.g. 2212

The PDG ID code (including nuclear codes) for the parent particle which this PDF
set (or member) describes. The most common are proton (2212), neutron (2112),
pion (211), photon (22), and nuclei like the deuteron (1000010020).


Flavors
-------
MANDATORY
(list<int> or int): [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,21]

List of supported (user-visible) parton flavors, using the PDG Monte Carlo
numbering scheme (quarks from 1 .. 6, antiquarks from -6 .. -1, and gluon = 21,
as well as any "optional extras" such as photon = 22).


NumMembers
----------
MANDATORY
(uint): 1

How many members there are in the set, including the central member(s) and error
set members.

@note There is no guarantee that all members are installed or that they are
consecutively numbered. This number is the official number of members in the
released set.


NumErrorMembers
---------------
OPTIONAL... may _become_ mandatory?
(uint): e.g. 50

How many members there are in the error part of this set, i.e. not counting any
central member(s).

TODO: Default to NumMembers - 1?

Assumed structure of PDF sets has first error member at Nmem = 1?

@note There is no guarantee that all members are installed or that they are
consecutively numbered. This number is the official number of error set members
in the released set.


Interpolator
------------
MANDATORY (for grid PDFs)
(enum string): linear, cubic, log, logcubic

The factory name string of the PDF grid interpolator to use -- only *needs* to
be specified if overriding the default, which is logcubic. Could also be
member-specific, if necessary. Linear and cubic are respectively linear and cubic interpolation
in the linear x & Q2 spaces, and log and logcubic are the same but in
the (recommended) log(x) and log(Q2) spaces.


Extrapolator
------------
MANDATORY (for grid PDFs)
(enum string): nearest,error

The factory name string of the PDF grid extrapolator to use. It is recommended
that this not be set to the "error" value in PDF data files; the choice of
whether out-of-range PDFs should throw errors should primarily be made by the
code *user*, and it is not the normally expected behaviour.


XMin, XMax
----------
MANDATORY
(float)

Minimum and maximum values of x in the PDF set. Could also be member-specific.


QMin, QMax
------------
MANDATORY
(float)

Minimum and maximum values of Q in the PDF set, in GeV. Could also be member-specific.


OrderQCD
--------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 2

Maximum number of loops considered in the QCD evolution of this set (i.e. 0 =
LO, 1 = NLO, etc.)


FlavorScheme
------------
MANDATORY
(enum string): fixed/variable

The flavour treatment scheme used in the fit's QCD evolution. alpha_s evolution
will use this value if AlphaS_FlavorScheme is not explicitly set.


NumFlavors
----------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 3, 4 or 5

Maximum/fixed number of flavors used in the fit. alpha_s evolution will use
this value if AlphaS_NumFlavors is not explicitly set.


AlphaS_MZ
---------
MANDATORY
(float): e.g. 0.118

The value of alpha_s at Q = MZ.


AlphaS_OrderQCD
---------------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 2

Maximum number of loops considered in the QCD evolution of alpha_s corresponding
to this PDF set (i.e. 0 = LO, 1 = NLO, etc.)


AlphaS_FlavorScheme
-------------------
OPTIONAL
(enum string): fixed/variable

The flavour treatment scheme used in alpha_s evolution for this PDF fit.
If unset, alpha_s evolution will fall back to using the FlavorScheme flag which
represents the QCD evolution used for the whole set, not just the alpha_s part.


AlphaS_NumFlavors
-----------------
OPTIONAL
(uint): e.g. 3, 4 or 5

Maximum/fixed number of flavors used in alpha_s evolution for this PDF fit.
If unset, alpha_s evolution will fall back to using the NumFlavors flag which
represents the QCD evolution used for the whole set, not just the alpha_s part.


AlphaS_Type
-----------
MANDATORY
(enum string): ode, analytic, ipol

The method to be used to calculate alpha_s for this set (cf. the AlphaS class
hierarchy).


AlphaS_Qs, AlphaS_vals
----------------------
MANDATORY if AlphaS_Type = ipol
(2 x list<float>)

A pair of lists for interpolation-based alpha_s(Q) solving (i.e. Alphas_Type =
ipol). The values of Q are in GeV, and the two lists must be the same length. If
only one of these keys is defined, or if their lengths are different, a metadata
exception will be thrown.


AlphaS_Lambda3, AlphaS_Lambda4, AlphaS_Lambda5
----------------------------------------------
MANDATORY if AlphaS_Type = analytic
(float): e.g. 0.192

The value of Lambda_QCD in 3, 4 and 5 flavour schemes, used with
AlphaS_OrderQCD in determining an alpha_s evolution corresponding
to this PDF set if the analytic alpha_s evaluation scheme is used.

A contiguous range of Lambda_n's must be provided, e.g. (3,4,5) or (4,5) or just
(5) are ok, but (3,5) is not.


ErrorType
---------
OPTIONAL (but should be present if there is an error set)
(enum string): replicas, symmhessian, hessian, custom, none

A set-level declaration of the type of error treatment provided by this set.

Additional members can be given at the end of a set to allow estimation of
uncertainties due to parameter variation (for example, alphaS or heavy-quark masses),
with string-formatting rules to specify how they are to be combined.

The top-level division of the error-type string is into components to be combined
in signed quadrature (i.e. separate quadrature combination for positive and negative
variations of the observable from the nominal. These components are separated by `+`
signs in the ErrorType string.

Each quadrature component is treated as a (+,-) pair, in general formed from the
envelope of several variation members. The named terms in such an envelope are
separated by `*` symbols, and their core name should follow C-like naming
restrictions: alphanumeric and underscore characters, and they cannot start with
a digit. You are encouraged to keep these names simple and limit use of
underscores to essential situations.

Each term corresponds to either one or two PDF members, depending on the optional
presence of a prefix symbol:
- if there is no prefix preceding the core name, it is taken to denote a
  (usually "up/down") parameter-variation pair;
- if there is a preceding `#` character, the term is derived from a single member
  with a resulting (+,0) or (0,-) error pair;
- and if prefixed by a `$` character, it represents a single variation-member
  whose effect is to be symmetrised to a (delta,delta) error pair.
A generally asymmetric envelope is returned from the union of these pairs as the
total (+,-) pair for that quadrature term.

Examples:
- `symmhessian`: a symmetric Hessian PDF error-set with no parameter variations.
- `replicas+alphas+mb`: a replica set with two pairs of parameter variations to be combined in quadrature.
- `hessian+alphas+$mc`: a Hessian set with a pair variation and a single-member variation to be symmetrised.
- `replicas+alphas+#fit1*#fit2*$foo+mb`: a replica set with a 3-member envelope made from a mix of asymmetric
    and symmetrised variations, and a final pair of variations: 4 error-groups to be combined in quadrature.

See the demonstration programs in "examples/testpdfunc.cc" and "examples/testpdfunc.py".


ErrorConfLevel
--------------
OPTIONAL (but should be present if there is a Hessian error set
with confidence level not equal to 1-sigma)
(int/float): e.g. 90

The confidence level of the Hessian error set eigenvectors, in percent.
If not present, assume 1-sigma = erf(1/sqrt(2)) = 68.2689...% by default.


CentralMember
-------------
OPTIONAL
(int): e.g. 0

The member ID in this PDF set of the main ("central") member. Usually 0. A
negative value indicates that this set has no central member.


FirstErrorMember
----------------
OPTIONAL
(uint): e.g. 1

The member ID in this PDF set of the first member of an error set. Usually 1.


MZ, MDown, MUp, MStrange, MCharm, MBottom, MTop
-----------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL
(float)

Masses of quarks and the Z0 boson in this PDF set's evolution. Default values
are set in the global LHAPDF config.


ThresholdDown, ThresholdUp, ThresholdStrange, ThresholdCharm, ThresholdBottom, ThresholdTop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL
(float)

Flavour activation thresholds for the quarks in this PDF set's evolution.
The masses (MDown, MUp, etc.) are used as default values if these are not set.


AlphaS_MDown, AlphaS_MUp, AlphaS_MStrange, AlphaS_MCharm, AlphaS_MBottom, AlphaS_MTop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL
(float)

Masses of quarks used in alpha_s evolution for this PDF. The raw PDF MDown,
MUp, etc. are used by default.


AlphaS_ThresholdDown, AlphaS_ThresholdUp, AlphaS_ThresholdStrange, AlphaS_ThresholdCharm, AlphaS_ThresholdBottom, AlphaS_ThresholdTop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL
(float)

Flavour activation thresholds for the quarks in alpha_s evolution for this PDF.
The raw PDF ThresholdDown, ThresholdUp, etc. are used by default, with fallback
to AlphaS_Threshold* and AlphaS_M* values.


MinLHAPDFVersion
----------------
OPTIONAL but should be present if some LHAPDF6 versions are incompatible.
(int): e.g. 600001

Minimal LHAPDF version code (integerised) needed to use this PDF.


DataVersion
-----------
MANDATORY
(int, default = -1)

The version of this PDF's data file, used to version fixes to the set.

@note Use a zero or negative value to flag this PDF as unsuitable for production
use. The LHAPDF system will produce a warning printout in that case.


ForcePositive
-------------
OPTIONAL
(uint = 0,1,2, default = 0)

If 0, no positivity forcing will be made. If 1, force returned PDF values to be
positive (always > 0), to avoid accidental interpolation overshoots into
negative values. If 2, force returned PDF values to be positive definite (always
> 1e-10), to avoid both negative values and *also* ensure that the PDF is never
exactly 0, to avoid issues with reweighting.


Note
----
OPTIONAL
(str)

An important short piece of usage information about this PDF set. Only use it
exceptionally, e.g. for marking that a PDF set is deprecated and users should
avoid it. The note will be printed into the online PDF table, and possibly used
by other external programs, but does not affect normal runtime behaviour.



MEMBER LEVEL
============

@note The flags listed here are simply most *likely* to be used at member-level,
but they can also be set at the set or global config level if so desired. This
tends not to make sense for most of the flags listed here, however. Flags set at
a more specific level always take precedence.

Format
------
MANDATORY
(enum string): lhagrid1, ... the trailing number is for format versioning.

Used to determine what parser should be instantiated to read the member file(s).


PdfDesc
-------
OPTIONAL
(free string): Description of the role of this PDF member


PdfType
-------
MANDATORY
(enum string): 'central' or 'error' or 'replica' or 'variation'

The type of this PDF, i.e. is it a central (canonical) PDF or is it meant for
use as either a Hessian error or a replica member of a statistical ensemble.
Parameter variation members given at the end of a set should have type 'variation',
(but 'central' is allowed for backward compatibility).
